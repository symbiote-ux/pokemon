          Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's

          Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from

          Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of

          Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away.

          This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body

          This Pokémon is not satisfied unless it is rampaging at all times. If
